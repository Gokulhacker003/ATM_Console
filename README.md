# ATM Console Application  

This repository contains a **Java-based console application** that simulates the core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), including **denomination-based withdrawals**. Users can log in, check their balance, deposit funds, withdraw money in specific denominations, transfer funds, and view transaction history.  

---

## Features  

âœ” **User Authentication** â€“ Secure login using User ID and PIN  
âœ” **Balance Inquiry** â€“ Check account balance  
âœ” **Denomination-Based Withdrawal** â€“ Withdraw a specific amount with denomination breakdown (e.g., â‚¹2000, â‚¹500, â‚¹200, â‚¹100)  
âœ” **Deposit Funds** â€“ Add money to the account  
âœ” **Fund Transfer** â€“ Transfer money to another userâ€™s account  
âœ” **Transaction History** â€“ View past transactions  
âœ” **Error Handling & Security** â€“ Prevents invalid inputs and unauthorized access

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gokulhacker003/ATM_Console.git
   cd ATM_Console
   ```

## Usage  

1. **Login** â€“ Enter your User ID and PIN.  
2. **Main Menu Options**:  
   - **1. Check Balance** â€“ Displays available account balance.  
   - **2. Withdraw Money (With Denominations)** â€“  
     - Enter the amount to withdraw.  
     - The system provides available denominations (â‚¹2000, â‚¹500, â‚¹200, â‚¹100).  
     - If the amount is valid, it will dispense cash in optimal denominations.  
   - **3. Deposit Money** â€“ Enter the amount to add funds.  
   - **4. Transfer Funds** â€“ Enter the recipient's account number and amount to transfer.  
   - **5. Transaction History** â€“ View details of recent transactions.  
   - **6. Exit** â€“ Log out of the system.

## **Code Structure & Analysis**  

The application is structured into multiple classes, each handling specific ATM functionalities.  

### **1. ATM.java (Main Class)**  
Handles user interactions and menu navigation.  
-  Initializes the **Bank** object and handles user login.  
-  Shows ATM options and calls respective methods.  

### **2. User.java (User Management)**  
Handles user authentication and account-related operations.  
-  Authenticates users with a PIN.  
-  Handles withdrawals with denomination calculations.  
-  Updates the balance after deposits.  

### **3. Bank.java (Database Simulation)**  
Manages user accounts.  
-  Registers a new user.  
-  Validates login credentials.  

### **4. Transaction.java (Transaction History Management)**  
Stores and retrieves transaction records.  
-  Returns transaction details in a readable format.  

### **5. DenominationHandler.java (New Feature for Withdrawals)**  
Calculates denominations for withdrawals.    
  - Breaks the amount into available currency notes (â‚¹2000, â‚¹500, â‚¹200, â‚¹100).  
  - Ensures the optimal number of notes is dispensed.  
  - Handles edge cases (e.g., if a certain denomination is unavailable).  

#### **Example Output for â‚¹4700 Withdrawal**  

```
Withdrawal Successful!
Denominations:
â‚¹2000 x 2
â‚¹500  x 1
â‚¹200  x 1
â‚¹100  x 2
Remaining Balance: â‚¹10,300
```

## **Error Handling & Validation**  

âœ” **Incorrect PIN Handling** â€“ Prevents unauthorized access.  
âœ” **Sufficient Balance Check** â€“ Ensures withdrawals do not exceed available funds.  
âœ” **Invalid Input Handling** â€“ Prevents negative or non-multiple amounts.  
âœ” **Denomination Constraints** â€“ Ensures withdrawal is possible based on available notes.  

---

## **Potential Improvements**  

- **Persistent Data Storage** â€“ Store user balances and transactions in a database (MySQL, SQLite).  
- **Enhanced Security** â€“ Encrypt stored PINs for improved security.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** â€“ Convert the console-based system into a JavaFX/Swing GUI.
